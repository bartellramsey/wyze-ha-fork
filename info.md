## Changelog
### 0.0.9(1) - Home Assistant 2021.4 patch
Fix versioning.

### 0.0.9 - More stability fixes
Prevents wyzesense from stopping when receiving an unparseable packet. Should help with stability issues.
Thanks to @raetha for the fix.

### 0.0.7 - Major Stability and Error fix
**WHEN UPGRADING TO THIS VERSION YOU WILL HAVE TO RETRIGGER EACH SENSOR TO HAVE IT DISPLAY AGAIN**

This is a one time thing you have to do once updating and restarting HomeAssistant. Once you do this, stability on restarts should improve dramatically. This specifically solves any errors that contain `result = ws.List()` in the error message. This is the vast majority of errors reported.
